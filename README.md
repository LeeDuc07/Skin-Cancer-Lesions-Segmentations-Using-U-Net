This is my small project for Processing Medical Image in my college 
Data : HAM10000 multi-source dermatoscopic images of pigmented skin lesions
Training of neural networks for automated diagnosis of pigmented skin lesions is hampered by the small size and lack of diversity of available datasets of dermatoscopic images. We tackle this problem by releasing the HAM10000 ("Human Against Machine with 10000 training images") dataset. We collected dermatoscopic images from different populations, acquired and stored by different modalities.

The final dataset consists of 10015 dermatoscopic images which can serve as a training set for academic machine learning purposes.

Cases include a representative collection of all important diagnostic categories in the realm of pigmented lesions:

AKIEC - actinic keratoses and intraepithelial carcinoma / Bowen's disease 

BCC - basal cell carcinoma 

BKL - benign keratosis-like lesions (solar lentigines / seborrheic keratoses and lichen-planus-like keratoses) 

DF - dermatofibroma 

MEL - melanoma 

NV - melanocytic nevi 

VC - vascular lesions (angiomas, angiokeratomas, pyogenic granulomas and haemorrhage)

More than 50% of lesions are confirmed through histopathology, the ground truth for the rest of the cases is either follow-up examination (follow_up), expert consensus (consensus), or confirmation by in-vivo confocal microscopy (confocal). The dataset includes lesions with multiple images, which can be tracked by the lesion_id-column within the metadata file.
